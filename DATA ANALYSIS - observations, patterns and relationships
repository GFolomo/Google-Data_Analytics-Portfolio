DATA ANALYSIS
*************
NB
- Aim: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders (customers) into annual members (subescribers) which translates into maximizing the business profit.
- Objective: to understand the difference between customers and subscribers in their ways of using bikes.

- Used tool: Excel

(1) DATA ORGANIZATION
    *****************
Pivot tables were created to easily organize data, have a quick visualization and conduct descriptive analysis.
Considering the relevant columns and aim of the project, the following pivot tables were created and converted 
into graphs to visualize and uncover trends, patterns, relationships and surprises:
- Count of Customer and Subscriber riders, showing the total and percentage distribution 
- Overall average trip duration by rider type
- Hourly count of rides by usertype
- Daily count of rides by usertype
- Montly count of rides by usertype
- Count of rides by usertype per month aggregated into seasons (summer, autumn and winter)
- Average daily trip duration

(2) DISCUSSION
    **********
1. Total rides count by usertype:
In 2013, customers accounted for 46% of the total recorded rides (745886) and subscribers 54%.
>> This revealed that there are opprtunities to convert a substantial number of customers into subscribers as customers make up almost half of the total.

2. Overall average trip duration by rider type:
>>On average, Customers have been observed to ride longer than subscribers hourly, daily, wekely, monthly and annually.

3. Hourly count of rides by usertype:
- Customers outnumbered subscribers from mid-night untill about 4:30 am, then from 10 am to 4pm, and again from 9pm to mid-night.
These time slopts have been termed off-peak hours
- Subscribers on the other hand, outnumbered customers during the remaning time slots, termed peak hours
- The hourly count of rides graph has shown a negative correlation between the two rider types. When customers are more active, subscribers are not
as many and vica versa

4. Daily rides count by usertype:
- Customers have been found to outnumber subscribers on weekends (Staturday and Sunday) only.
- Subscribers are a lot more during week days (Monday to Friday)

5. Monthly count of rides by usertype
- Customers have been found to outnumber subscribers from June to September
- Subscribers then take over from October to December

6. Seasonal count
- Summer has been observed to be the only season when customers ride more often
- Subscribers on the other hand, outnumbered customers in Autumn and Winter
7. Average daily trip duration
- On average, customers ride daily for about 21 to 25 minutes whereas subcribers ride for about 11 to 13 minutes
- This implies that customers travel slightly longer distances than subscribers on average.
