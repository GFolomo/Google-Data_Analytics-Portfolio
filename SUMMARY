CONCLUSION
**********
1) From the hourly and daily visuals, it may be inferred that customers are mostly people not in the normal working 
class. They seem to be people who randmonly use bikes during the day to move from one point to another.

2) Customers tend to control their movements as it was found that they often travel during off-peak hours. Due to lack of 
data to draw an informed conclusion, it may be inferred that they make up a certain category of people doing specific 
jobs or attend specific events and therefore only working specific hours days, and/or weekends

3) 27% of customers have been found to travel from top 10 stations, while 47% travel from top 30 stations by count of rides. 
This information is relevant as it makes it possible to locate them. Knowing their points of departure makes marketing 
compaings more area-specific. These stations can be targeted as a starting point as they account for almost half of the
customers category. Put simply, 47% of 343772 customers travel from 30 stations out of 692 stations across Chicago.

4) The business needs to create and promote tailor-made and discounted rates during customers frequent favorite travelling hours, 
days and season of the year to attract them towards annual membership. For instance, the first month a customer subscribes as a memeber, 
one should have free rides, or a voucher or perhaps no joining fee if applicable. 

5) It would be insightful to have the missing gender and birthyear information about customers to further drill into this quest
to better understand the age group and/or gender that make up the majority of this category. This would definitely sheds more lights in 
the analysis.
